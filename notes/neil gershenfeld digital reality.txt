WORKING RELIABLY WITH UNRELIABLE PARTS

Digital is one of the most widely misunderstood concepts.



Digitilization of communication: Claud Shannon
  Claude Shannon Threshold theorem:
    For a linear increase in the resource used to represent the symbol, there is an exponential reduction in the error of you getting the symbol correctly as long as the noise is below a threshold.
    => You can communicate reliably even though the communication medium is unreliable

Digitilization of computing: John von Neumann
  John von Neumann showed that you could compute reliably with an unreliable computing device by computing with a symbol. It was exactly applying Shannon to viewing a computation as a communication through the channel of the computer. 

Digitilisation of fabrication:
  MIT 1952 the first numerically-controlled milling machine
  3D printers

personalise fabrication

fab lab: Anybody can make almost anything almost anywhere

bits and atoms

turnover and evolutionary pressure are essential
