Memcached is essentially a hash table provided as a network service. Client applications can get and set key-value pairs just like an ordinary hash table. The main benefit of using memcached is that the result of an expensive request (like rendering a graph) can be stored very quickly and retrieved later to handle subsequent requests. -- source http://www.aosabook.org/en/graphite.html
